Built within a week using Spring Boot, Gradle and Java, Guesty is a guestbook web app featuring an admin account that allows an authorized user to edit guestbook entries -- and much more.

## Features

### A regular user can...
* Sign the guestbook and see the names of everyone else who has signed it

### An admin can...
* Use a secure login to  view all guestbook data
* Search, edit, add or delete guestbook entries in a paginated, responsive table that leverages the [Editable Grid library](http://www.editablegrid.net/en/)
* Select all users or specific users as email targets
* Keep a record of guests to email later, or clear those selections
* Send emails to selected users (or all users at once) with an in-browser interface that includes error handling


## Other technologies and languages used include:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* CSS3
* HTML5
* Thymeleaf templating
* MySQL
* Heroku
